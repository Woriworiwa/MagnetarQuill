---

### **User Flow for Text Formatting**
- **Selection-Based Application**: Users can highlight text and apply bold, italics, etc., directly to the selection. The same applies to font changes, colors, and alignment.
- **Global Setting**: If no text is selected, changes will affect the text typed after the formatting action.
- **Clear Formatting**: A "clear formatting" button will reset any formatting applied to the selected text.

---

### **Performance Considerations**
- **Minimal DOM Manipulation**: Keep DOM manipulations to a minimum when applying formatting, especially with large documents.
- **Efficient Undo/Redo**: Ensure that each formatting change creates a history state, allowing easy undo/redo without performance hits.

---

### **Edge Cases**
- **Mixed Formatting**: When text with mixed formatting is selected, the toolbar should reflect an "indeterminate" state (e.g., the bold button is highlighted if part of the selection is bold).
- **Nested Formatting**: Handle cases where users apply overlapping formatting (e.g., bold inside italic text), ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers.

---


### **2. Content Structuring - Detailed Specification**

---

#### **2.1 Headers**

- **Custom Header Levels**:
  - **Available Levels**: H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6.
  - **UI Element**: A dropdown in the toolbar displaying header options (e.g., "Heading 1", "Heading 2", etc.).
  - **Behavior**: When a header level is selected, it changes the format of the current paragraph or the selected text to the appropriate header level.
  - **Shortcut**: Provide shortcuts for header levels (e.g., `Ctrl+1` for H1, `Ctrl+2` for H2).
  - **Implementation**:
    - HTML: Uses `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc., tags.
    - RTF/Markdown: Map to appropriate header formats based on the export format.

- **Custom Styling**:
  - Allow users to **define custom styles** for headers (e.g., font, color, size). These styles can be modified via a settings panel.
  - **Default Styles**: Provide default styling for each header level that can be overridden by users.

- **Multiple Headings in Selection**:
  - If the selection spans multiple paragraphs with different headings, the editor should show the heading as “mixed” or "indeterminate" in the UI.

---

#### **2.2 Lists**

- **Ordered (Numbered) Lists**:
  - **UI Element**: A button in the toolbar for creating ordered lists.
  - **Behavior**:
    - When clicked, it converts the selected text or paragraph into an ordered list item.
    - Subsequent `Enter` key presses should automatically create new list items.
  - **Numbering Format**: Default to numbers (1, 2, 3), but allow customization (e.g., Roman numerals I, II, III or alphabetic a, b, c).
  - **Implementation**:
    - HTML: Uses `<ol>` (ordered list) and `<li>` (list item) tags.
    - RTF/Markdown: Map to numbered list formatting.

- **Unordered (Bullet) Lists**:
  - **UI Element**: A button in the toolbar for creating unordered lists.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Converts the selected text or paragraph into a bulleted list item.
    - Pressing `Enter` creates new bullet points.
  - **Bullet Types**: Provide multiple bullet styles (e.g., dots, dashes, squares).
  - **Implementation**:
    - HTML: Uses `<ul>` (unordered list) and `<li>` tags.
    - RTF/Markdown: Map to bullet list formatting.

- **Nested Lists**:
  - **Indentation**: Users can increase or decrease list indentation via the toolbar or shortcuts (`Tab` to increase indent, `Shift+Tab` to decrease).
  - **Behavior**: Indenting a list item will nest it under the previous list item, creating a **sublist**.
  - **Multi-Level Lists**: The editor should support multi-level lists, with the ability to switch between bullet and numbered list types at different levels.

- **List Continuation**:
  - Lists should continue when the user presses `Enter` at the end of a list item, but pressing `Enter` twice should end the list and switch back to a paragraph format.

---

#### **2.3 Indentation Control**

- **Paragraph Indentation**:
  - **UI Element**: Buttons in the toolbar to **increase** and **decrease** indentation.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Increases or decreases the indentation of the current paragraph or selected text.
    - **Custom Values**: Users should be able to define custom indentation sizes (e.g., 10px, 20px).
  - **Implementation**:
    - HTML: Uses `style="margin-left:..."` or `style="text-indent:..."`.

- **List Indentation**:
  - The same indentation controls apply to lists, allowing users to **nest list items**.
  - **Tab and Shift+Tab** shortcuts should adjust the list levels.
  
---

#### **2.4 Block Elements**

- **Block Formats**:
  - **Paragraph**:
    - **UI Element**: Paragraph is the default format in the dropdown (along with headers, lists).
    - **Behavior**: Resets any special formatting (e.g., heading, preformatted text) to standard paragraph text.
    - **Implementation**: Wraps text in `<p>` tags in HTML and the corresponding tags in other formats.
  
  - **Preformatted Text**:
    - **UI Element**: Available in the block format dropdown.
    - **Behavior**: Formats text as **preformatted** (i.e., preserves whitespace and uses a monospaced font).
    - **Implementation**: Uses `<pre>` tags in HTML to preserve formatting exactly as typed (e.g., spaces, line breaks).
    - **Use Case**: Useful for code snippets or text where spacing and formatting must remain untouched.
  
  - **Custom Blocks**:
    - **UI Element**: A "Custom Block" option in the block format dropdown.
    - **Behavior**: Allows users to apply a custom-defined block style, which could include specific font settings, background colors, padding, and borders.
    - **Implementation**: Uses a combination of `<div>` or `<section>` tags with custom CSS classes (e.g., `.custom-block`).
    - **Custom Block Settings**: Users can define custom styles for blocks, like colored backgrounds for callouts or bordered boxes for special content.
    - **Drag-and-Drop**: Allow users to drag these blocks around within the document for flexible positioning.

---

### **User Flow for Content Structuring**

- **Headers**: When a user selects a header option (H1, H2, etc.), the current paragraph or selected block will change its format to that header level. If the user selects a custom header style, it will apply the associated styles (font, color, size).
  
- **Lists**: Lists will automatically format paragraphs as ordered or unordered lists. Pressing `Enter` creates a new list item, and pressing `Tab` indents it to create a nested list. `Shift+Tab` will decrease the indent level, making the list item part of the previous level.

- **Block Elements**: Users can switch between different block types (e.g., paragraph, preformatted text) based on the nature of their content. Custom blocks will be stylized and adjustable for special purposes.

---

### **Performance Considerations**

- **Efficient DOM Management**: When switching between list items, headers, and block formats, the editor should ensure minimal DOM manipulation to avoid performance hits on large documents.
  
- **Consistency in Mixed Formatting**: Handle cases where multiple block types are selected. For example, when switching between a header and paragraph format, maintain formatting consistency across selections.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **Mixed Lists and Headers**: If a list contains multiple headers, the editor should handle the formatting properly without breaking the list structure. For example, if a user applies a heading to a list item, it should still behave like a list while adopting the header style.

- **Empty List Items**: If a user creates a list item but leaves it empty and presses `Enter`, the list should end, and the cursor should return to a regular paragraph.

- **Custom Block Removal**: When switching from a custom block to a regular paragraph, ensure that all custom styles are properly cleared.

- **Responsive Table Management**: Ensure that large or complex tables are handled efficiently in the DOM, preventing slow rendering or interaction delays.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **Broken Links**: When a link’s URL is invalid or broken, provide a visual indication (e.g., underlining the link in red).
- **Media Loading Failures**: If an image or video fails to load (due to network issues or broken URL), display a placeholder and allow the user to retry or replace the media.
- **Large Media Files**: Warn users when large images or videos are uploaded that could affect performance.

---

### **4. Object Management - Detailed Specification**

---

#### **4.1 Internal Context Menu**

- **Overview**:
  - Each object, whether it’s an image, table, video, or code block, will have its own **context menu** for easy manipulation.
  - The context menu will be accessible via **right-click** on the object or via a dedicated menu button in the toolbar when the object is selected.

- **Context Menu Features**:
  - **Edit Properties**:
    - For images, tables, and videos, users can modify attributes like **size**, **position**, and **alt text** (for images).
    - For tables, users can add or remove rows/columns, and adjust cell borders or background colors.
    - Videos will allow control over **dimensions**, **autoplay**, and **mute** settings.
    - **Implementation**: Each object type will have a dedicated properties dialog to handle its specific settings.
  
  - **Cut, Copy, Paste**:

    - **Paste**: Users can paste the object elsewhere in the document with `Ctrl+V`.
    - **Implementation**: Objects should maintain all their properties (e.g., size, alignment, captions) when pasted.

  - **Delete**:
    - A **delete** option will be available to remove the selected object from the document.
    - **Implementation**: The object and its associated data (e.g., alt text, captions) should be removed entirely without leaving residual code or empty tags.
  
  - **Repositioning Objects**:
    - Objects can be moved via the context menu to reposition them within the flow of the document.
    - Options such as **Move to Top** or **Move to Bottom** will allow users to quickly shift an object's placement within the document.

---

#### **4.2 Drag-and-Drop**

- **Support for Drag-and-Drop**:
  - Users will be able to **drag-and-drop** objects such as images, tables, and videos to reposition them within the document.
  - **Behavior**:
    - When an object is clicked and dragged, a visual placeholder will appear, showing the potential new position in the document.
    - Objects should smoothly transition to their new location upon release.
    - **Multi-Object Dragging**: Allow users to select multiple objects and drag them together as a group.

- **Snap to Position**:
  - Objects will "snap" into place based on the document’s content flow or grid system.
  - Ensure objects align neatly with surrounding text, maintaining document structure and readability.

- **Drag Handles**:
  - When an object is selected, visible **drag handles** will appear on the object’s borders, enabling users to grab and move them easily.
  - **Keyboard Accessibility**: Allow users to move objects with arrow keys for precision placement.

---

#### **4.3 Layering**

- **Adjusting Object Layering (Z-Index)**:
  - Objects can be layered over one another, allowing users to control which objects appear **on top** or **behind** others.
  - **UI Element**: A toolbar dropdown or context menu option with "Bring Forward," "Send Backward," "Bring to Front," "Send to Back" controls.
  
- **Behavior**:
  - When an object’s layering is adjusted, it will visually update in real-time within the document.
  - Layering applies to objects like images, videos, tables, and custom block elements.
  
- **Implementation**:
  - Use CSS `z-index` properties to adjust the layering of objects in HTML mode.
  - Ensure that this functionality is preserved across export formats (RTF, Markdown) if layering is supported by the output format.

- **Use Case**:
  - This is particularly useful for **overlapping media** (e.g., when users want text to wrap around an image that floats above or below certain sections).

---

  - **Tables**: Allow dynamic resizing of individual rows and columns. Ensure table contents (text, media) resize proportionally.
  - **Videos**: Maintain the original video dimensions unless explicitly changed by the user.
  - **Custom Blocks**: If custom blocks include text, ensure the text size adjusts as the block is resized or provide scrollable content.

- **Live Preview**:
  - As objects are resized, the editor will provide a **live preview** of how the object will look in its new size, ensuring users can see the exact dimensions before finalizing the change.

---

### **User Flow for Object Management**

- **Context Menu**: Users right-click on any object (image, table, video, etc.) to access a context menu that allows them to cut, copy, delete, or modify the object’s properties.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Users can click and drag objects to reposition them. Visual guides and snapping help align objects neatly with surrounding content.
- **Layering**: When multiple objects overlap, users can adjust their z-index via a context menu or toolbar option, ensuring precise control over the visual hierarchy.
- **Resizing**: Upon selecting an object, users can resize it using the corner handles. Aspect ratios are maintained unless explicitly unlocked.

---

### **Performance Considerations**

- **Efficient Repositioning**: Ensure that the drag-and-drop mechanism updates the DOM only when necessary, preventing performance degradation in large documents.
- **Layering Across Large Documents**: Handle layering changes smoothly even in documents with many overlapping objects, ensuring no visual glitches or reflows occur.
- **Object Resizing Efficiency**: Minimize rendering updates while resizing objects by deferring certain adjustments (e.g., final image rendering) until the user finishes resizing.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **Object Overlap Conflicts**: If multiple objects are resized or repositioned to overlap, ensure that the **layering controls** allow users to easily resolve conflicts (e.g., images behind text or vice versa).
- **Mixed Object Selection**: When multiple objects of different types (e.g., image and video) are selected, provide intuitive behavior for batch operations like cutting, copying, or moving.
- **Snap Behavior**: Ensure that the snap-to-position functionality is neither too rigid nor too loose, allowing users to place objects freely while maintaining document structure.
- **Aspect Ratio Issues**: Provide clear feedback when aspect ratios are locked or unlocked to prevent user confusion while resizing images or videos.

---

### **5. Clipboard Support - Detailed Specification**

---

#### **5.1 Cut, Copy, Paste**

- **Overview**:
  - The editor will provide **full support** for cutting, copying, and pasting content, including rich text, images, tables, and other embedded media.

- **Rich Text Support**:
  - **Behavior**:
    - When rich text (formatted text with bold, italic, color, etc.) is cut, copied, or pasted, the formatting should be preserved.
    - Formatting includes bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, font family, font size, color, background color, superscript, subscript, alignment, lists, headers, etc.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Pasting content from external sources (e.g., web pages, word processors) should maintain the original formatting as much as possible while ensuring consistency with the editor’s supported styles.

- **Media Support**:
  - **Behavior**:
    - Users should be able to cut, copy, and paste media such as images, tables, and videos without losing their properties (e.g., size, alignment, captions, links).
  - **Implementation**:
    - When a media element is cut or copied, it should retain all associated metadata (e.g., alt text for images, video autoplay settings) and be pasted with full fidelity.

- **Cross-Document Support**:
  - Users should be able to copy content from one document and paste it into another instance of the editor, maintaining formatting and media.
  - **Cross-Application Support**:
    - Ensure compatibility with content pasted from external applications like **Microsoft Word**, **Google Docs**, **Web Browsers**, etc.

---

#### **5.2 Pasting Images**

- **Automatic Image Capture**:
  - **Behavior**:
    - When an image is pasted from an external source (e.g., copied from a browser, desktop, or another document), the editor should automatically capture and embed the image.
    - The pasted image should be treated as if it were uploaded via the file dialog, allowing full control over resizing, editing, and properties.
  
- **Clipboard Image Formats**:
  - **Supported Formats**: The editor should support commonly copied image formats such as **JPEG**, **PNG**, **GIF**, and **SVG**.
  - **Base64 Encoding**: If pasting from an external source where the image data is not directly linked, the editor should encode the image as **Base64** for inline embedding.
  
- **Image Properties After Pasting**:
  - **Resizable**: Once pasted, the image should have resizing handles for users to adjust its size.
  - **Editable**: Users should be able to edit properties like **alt text**, **alignment**, and **captions**.
  - **Image Optimization**: Implement background processes to optimize the size of pasted images (e.g., compress large files) to prevent performance issues in large documents.

- **Edge Case**:
  - If the user pastes an unsupported image format or if the image cannot be loaded, provide a clear error message and fallback (e.g., a placeholder image or an error message inside the document).

---

#### **5.3 Rich Text Formatting**

- **Consistent Formatting for Pasted Text**:
  - **Behavior**:
    - When pasting rich text from external sources, the editor should preserve the formatting as much as possible without introducing incompatible styles.
    - The pasted text should be **sanitized** to ensure it doesn’t introduce external styles that may break the editor’s layout or styling.
  - **Supported Formatting**:
    - **Bold**, **italic**, **underline**, **strikethrough**.
    - **Font family**, **font size**, **text color**, and **background color**.
    - **Text alignment**, **lists**, **headers**, and **blockquotes**.
    - **Superscript** and **subscript**.

- **Sanitization Process**:
  - **Sanitization**: Strip out unnecessary or potentially harmful HTML tags, scripts, or styles that could interfere with the document structure or pose a security risk (e.g., inline JavaScript or external stylesheets).
  - **Retain Essential Styling**: Ensure that essential text formatting (font styles, color, alignment) is retained when pasting from external applications like Google Docs, Word, or websites.
  
- **HTML and External Sources**:
  - When pasting content from **HTML-rich sources** (e.g., web pages), strip any inline CSS or external styling and convert the content to match the editor’s supported formatting.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use a whitelist of allowed HTML tags (e.g., `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`) to ensure that pasted content doesn’t break the document structure.

---

### **User Flow for Clipboard Support**

- **Cut/Copy/Paste Operations**:
  - Users can select content (text, images, tables, etc.) and use the standard keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+X`, `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+V`) to move content within the document or between the editor and other applications.
  - Pasted content should immediately reflect the editor's formatting standards, with rich text preserving its styles, and media retaining its properties.

- **Pasting from External Sources**:
  - When pasting from other applications or websites, the editor will sanitize the content to match its own formatting rules. Text formatting should remain consistent, and any unsupported styles should be discarded without breaking the document.
  - Images pasted from the clipboard should automatically embed and become editable within the document.

---

### **Performance Considerations**

- **Handling Large Images**:
  - Optimize large image files that are pasted into the document to avoid performance degradation. For example, automatically resize images if they exceed a certain file size or dimension.
  
- **Clipboard Event Monitoring**:
  - Ensure efficient monitoring of clipboard events to avoid unnecessary DOM manipulations when users cut, copy, or paste content.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **Corrupt or Unsupported Media**: If the user pastes media that is corrupt or unsupported, the editor should display a warning and not attempt to embed the media.
- **HTML Styles from External Sources**: When pasting from websites with heavy CSS, the editor should strip out conflicting styles while retaining essential formatting. For example, if the website uses custom fonts or special classes, these should be removed to maintain document integrity.
- **Rich Text from Non-Standard Sources**: Ensure that content pasted from non-standard sources (e.g., specialized software or text editors) is handled gracefully and doesn’t break the document layout.

---


### **6. Undo/Redo & History - Detailed Specification**

---

#### **6.1 Undo/Redo Functionality**

- **Overview**:
  - The editor will implement **undo/redo** functionality, allowing users to reverse and reapply changes with multiple history steps.
  - This will ensure that users can easily correct mistakes or revisit earlier document states without losing work.

- **UI Elements**:
  - **Undo Button**: A button in the toolbar (typically an arrow curving left) to undo the most recent action.
  - **Redo Button**: A button in the toolbar (typically an arrow curving right) to reapply an undone action.
  - **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
    - **Undo**: `Ctrl+Z` (or `Cmd+Z` on Mac).
    - **Redo**: `Ctrl+Y` (or `Cmd+Shift+Z` on Mac).

---

#### **6.2 Multiple History Steps**

- **History Tracking**:
  - **Behavior**:
    - The editor should track multiple actions in a **history stack**, allowing users to undo/redo multiple steps.
    - Each action, such as text insertion, formatting changes, image addition, or object movement, should be treated as a single history step.
  - **Grouping Actions**:
    - Small continuous actions, like typing several characters or deleting a paragraph, can be grouped into one history step to prevent excessive clutter in the undo history.
    - Larger changes (e.g., inserting a table, adding an image) should each be treated as a separate step in the history.

- **Supported Actions**:
  - **Text Changes**: All text entry, deletion, and formatting operations should be undoable.
  - **Media Insertion and Editing**: Insertions of images, videos, tables, and their subsequent adjustments (e.g., resizing, aligning) should be tracked.
  - **Object Movement**: Drag-and-drop operations that reposition objects in the document should be undoable.
  - **Structural Changes**: Adding/removing headers, lists, and block elements should also be part of the undo/redo functionality.

---

#### **6.3 History Management**

- **Efficient History Tracking**:
  - To avoid performance degradation, the editor should manage the history stack efficiently, discarding excessively old actions when necessary (for example, after reaching a certain number of steps or memory usage threshold).
  
- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - **Auto-save with Undo History**: Ensure that auto-saving doesn’t disrupt or clear the undo history, allowing users to maintain undo/redo functionality even after a save.
  - **Selective History**: If certain complex operations (like file imports or batch operations) cannot be easily undone, notify the user before the operation, explaining that it’s irreversible.

---

### **User Flow for Undo/Redo**

- **Undoing Actions**:
  - Users can undo recent changes using the toolbar button or `Ctrl+Z` (Cmd+Z). Each press of the undo shortcut will step back through the document's history, restoring the document to its previous state.
  - Changes such as text deletions, formatting, image insertions, and object movement will all be undone in the reverse order they were performed.

- **Redoing Actions**:
  - After undoing changes, users can press `Ctrl+Y` (Cmd+Shift+Z) to redo those actions step by step. This will reapply the last undone changes.
  - Redoing operations should function smoothly, even after a user undoes multiple steps.

---

### **Performance Considerations**

- **Optimizing Memory Usage**:
  - **Memory Limitation**: Limit the number of undo/redo steps to balance between functionality and memory usage, especially in larger documents with many media files.
  - **Action Grouping**: Group repetitive small actions like continuous typing or small adjustments to avoid unnecessary memory overhead from tracking every tiny change.

- **Delayed Execution**:
  - For complex actions (e.g., inserting large images, applying bulk changes), the editor should ensure that undoing these operations doesn’t cause delays or freezes.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **Undo/Redo with Large Media**:
  - Undoing or redoing the insertion or deletion of large media files (e.g., videos or high-resolution images) should not slow down the editor’s performance. These media files should be tracked as lightweight references in the undo history.
  
- **Document Save and History Preservation**:
  - Ensure that when a document is saved, the undo history is preserved so that users can continue undoing actions post-save without clearing the history stack.

- **Partial Undo States**:
  - Handle cases where users undo partial complex actions (e.g., editing a table). For instance, if a user adds a row and later deletes it, undoing both actions should restore the table to its exact previous state, including content and layout.

---

### **7. File Operations - Detailed Specification**

---

#### **7.1 Save As**

- **Export Formats**:
  - The editor will support exporting the document in multiple formats to provide flexibility for users and ensure compatibility with different platforms.

- **Supported Export Formats**:
  - **HTML**:
    - **Behavior**: When exporting as HTML, the document should be saved as a valid HTML file, retaining all rich text formatting, images, media elements, and structural components (e.g., headers, lists, tables).
    - **Implementation**: Use clean and well-structured HTML tags to ensure cross-browser compatibility. Embedded media (images, videos) can be either base64-encoded or linked as separate files, depending on user preference.
  
  - **RTF (Rich Text Format)**:
    - **Behavior**: Exporting as RTF should preserve all rich text formatting, including font styles, alignment, lists, and media.
    - **Implementation**: Map the document structure to the appropriate RTF elements to maintain fidelity with the original document layout.
  
  - **Markdown**:
    - **Behavior**: When exporting as Markdown, the document should convert to simplified text with Markdown-specific syntax for formatting (e.g., `#` for headers, `*` for lists, `**` for bold text).
    - **Implementation**: Convert formatting like headers, bold, italics, lists, and links to Markdown equivalents. Embed images using Markdown syntax (`![alt text](image_url)`).
    - **Limitations**: Markdown will not fully support advanced formatting like tables or embedded videos, so a warning should be displayed if these features are present in the document.

  - **PDF**:
    - **Behavior**: Exporting as PDF should ensure that the document retains proper formatting for printing, including page breaks, headers/footers, and media placement.
    - **Implementation**: Use a backend service or library (e.g., **html2pdf** or **PDFKit**) to convert the document to a PDF. Ensure media and text are rendered correctly, and adjust page layouts (e.g., margins, orientation) for print quality.
  
- **UI Element**:
  - A **Save As** button in the toolbar or file menu that opens a dialog where users can select the desired export format.
  - Provide options for naming the file and selecting the export path.

- **Behavior**:
  - Once the export format is selected, the document will be converted and saved locally or offered for download.
  - **Advanced Options**:
    - For formats like **HTML** or **Markdown**, provide additional options such as:
      - **Include media as base64** or **link external media**.
      - **Customize file structure** (e.g., export as a single file or a folder with media assets).

---

#### **7.2 Load Files**

- **Supported Input Formats**:
  - **HTML**:
    - **Behavior**: Users should be able to load existing HTML documents into the editor for continued editing.
    - **Implementation**: Upon loading an HTML file, parse and render the document while preserving all styles, media, and structural elements. Ensure that any external links (e.g., images or scripts) are correctly referenced or embedded into the document.
  
  - **RTF**:
    - **Behavior**: Users should be able to load RTF documents, with all rich text formatting preserved.
    - **Implementation**: Convert RTF elements to the corresponding editor elements (e.g., bold, italics, tables). Handle RTF media embedding to display images and other objects correctly.
  
  - **Importing Limitations**:
    - For unsupported file types (e.g., PDFs or Word docs), notify the user with an error message and suggest alternatives (e.g., converting the document to an editable format before loading).

- **UI Element**:
  - A **Load** button in the toolbar or file menu that opens a file dialog for selecting the document to load.
  - Once the document is loaded, it should be displayed in the editor with full editing capabilities.

- **Behavior**:
  - When a file is loaded, the editor should replace the current document with the loaded content while preserving the undo/redo history for the current session (if the user hasn't explicitly started a new session).

---

#### **7.3 Auto-Save**

- **Overview**:
  - The editor will support **auto-save** functionality to periodically store the user’s work to prevent data loss due to unexpected issues (e.g., browser crashes, network disruptions).

- **Auto-Save Behavior**:
  - **Interval-Based Saving**:
    - Automatically save the document at set intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes). The interval should be adjustable by the user.
  - **Manual Save**:
    - Users should also have the option to manually trigger a save at any time by clicking a **Save** button in the toolbar or pressing a shortcut (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`).
  
  - **Local or Server-Based Saving**:
    - **Local Storage**: For browser-based editors, auto-saves can be stored in **localStorage** or **IndexedDB**, allowing users to recover their document if they accidentally close the browser.
    - **Server-Side Auto-Save**: For cloud-based editors, implement auto-save functionality that uploads changes to a server at regular intervals, ensuring that users can access their latest progress from any device.

- **Save Notifications**:
  - Display a **notification** or a status bar message ("Document auto-saved") to let users know that auto-saving has occurred.
  - Notify users of any save errors, with an option to retry.

- **Conflict Handling**:
  - If multiple instances of the same document are being edited, implement conflict detection to warn users about conflicting changes, with options to merge, overwrite, or save a copy.

---

### **User Flow for File Operations**

- **Saving Documents**:
  - Users can select **Save As** from the toolbar or file menu to export the document in their desired format (HTML, RTF, Markdown, or PDF). The export dialog will allow users to customize the export settings, such as embedding media or linking it externally.
  
- **Loading Documents**:
  - Users can load an existing document (HTML or RTF) into the editor. The content will be parsed and editable, with full formatting and media intact. A notification should be displayed if unsupported features (e.g., from Word documents) are detected.
  
- **Auto-Save**:
  - The editor will auto-save at regular intervals without disrupting the user’s workflow. Users will be informed when auto-saves occur and can manually save the document at any time. In case of crashes or reloads, the document will be recoverable from local storage or the cloud.

---

### **Performance Considerations**

- **Efficient Exporting**:
  - Ensure that exporting large documents (with many images or media elements) is handled efficiently without significantly delaying the user’s workflow. Export processes should run in the background if necessary.
  
- **Load Optimization**:
  - For large or complex documents, load the content incrementally or use lazy loading for media elements to avoid performance slowdowns during the initial load.
  
- **Auto-Save Efficiency**:
  - Ensure auto-save does not cause noticeable delays or interruptions while the user is typing or editing. Optimize the save mechanism to handle small, incremental changes rather than re-saving the entire document each time.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **Incompatible Files**: 
  - If the user attempts to load an unsupported file format (e.g., PDF or DOCX), the editor should display an error message and provide guidance for converting the file into a compatible format.
  
- **Media Loss on Export**:
  - Ensure that when exporting as Markdown, unsupported features like tables or embedded videos are clearly flagged to the user, with a suggestion to use HTML for better fidelity.

- **Auto-Save During Network Loss**:
  - If using a server-based auto-save system, ensure that the editor handles network disruptions gracefully. If the network goes down, save the document locally and retry uploading when the connection is restored.

---

### **8. Editor Layout - Detailed Specification**

---

#### **8.1 Full-Screen Mode**

- **Overview**:
  - Provide a **toggle** to enter a distraction-free, **full-screen editing mode**. This mode allows users to focus on their content by maximizing the editor space and hiding unnecessary UI elements.

- **UI Element**:
  - A **Full-Screen** button in the toolbar or file menu to trigger the mode. Additionally, a keyboard shortcut (`F11` or a custom combination) can be used to enter or exit full-screen mode.

- **Behavior**:
  - When activated, the editor will expand to fill the entire browser window, hiding all other browser tabs, toolbars, and operating system taskbars. The editor’s toolbar and content area will adapt to the full-screen environment.
  - **Distraction-Free Mode**:
    - Optionally, when full-screen is enabled, a "distraction-free" mode can hide the toolbar and other UI elements (e.g., sidebars), leaving only the content visible for pure writing focus.

- **Exit Full-Screen**:
  - The user can exit full-screen mode by pressing the toggle button again or using the escape key (`Esc`).
  
- **Implementation**:
  - Use the browser’s native full-screen API (`document.documentElement.requestFullscreen()` and `document.exitFullscreen()`).
  - Ensure the editor remains functional in full-screen mode, with all editing features intact.

---

#### **8.2 Customizable Toolbar**

- **Overview**:
  - Allow users to **customize the toolbar layout**, giving them control over which tools are visible, how they are arranged, and whether they are grouped or separated.

- **Toolbar Customization Features**:
  - **Show/Hide Tools**:
    - Users can choose which tools to display in the toolbar. For example, some users may prefer a minimalist layout with only basic text formatting tools, while others may want full access to all options (e.g., tables, images, videos).
  - **Drag-and-Drop Tool Arrangement**:
    - Users can rearrange tools within the toolbar by dragging icons to different positions.
    - **Grouping**: Users can group related tools (e.g., bold, italic, underline) into custom toolsets.
  - **Preset Layouts**:
    - Provide pre-configured layouts for different types of users (e.g., writers, coders, designers). Users can choose a preset layout or create their own.
  - **Expand/Collapse Sections**:
    - The toolbar will have sections that can be expanded or collapsed to hide infrequently used tools while keeping the essentials visible.
  
- **UI for Customization**:
  - A **Customize Toolbar** button or menu item should open a dialog where users can select which tools are visible, drag them into new positions, and group them as needed.
  - **Shortcut Management**: In this dialog, users can also assign custom keyboard shortcuts to specific tools for faster access.

- **Behavior**:
  - Customizations should be saved per user, either in local storage (for browser-based implementations) or synced to their account (for cloud-based editors).
  - **Reset to Default**: Provide an option to restore the toolbar to its default layout if needed.

---

#### **8.3 Responsive Design**

- **Overview**:
  - The editor should be **fully responsive**, ensuring that it functions seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes, from desktops to tablets and mobile devices.

- **Layout Adjustments**:
  - **Desktop View**:
    - On large screens (e.g., desktops), the editor will display the full toolbar with all tools visible, along with side panels or additional options (e.g., document outline, word count).
    - The main content area should take advantage of the available space, expanding horizontally to allow for better visibility of wide documents (e.g., tables or multi-column layouts).
  
  - **Tablet View**:
    - On medium-sized screens (e.g., tablets), the toolbar should adjust by collapsing less frequently used tools into a dropdown menu or secondary bar.
    - The content area should still provide a rich editing experience but with some adjustments, like larger touch-friendly buttons.
    - Drag-and-drop and resizing features should be touch-optimized.

  - **Mobile View**:
    - On small screens (e.g., mobile phones), the toolbar will collapse further, showing only essential tools (e.g., bold, italic, insert image). Advanced tools can be accessed via a menu or expandable toolbar.
    - The editor will switch to a single-column view, ensuring text and media are easy to navigate on smaller screens.
    - **Touch Gestures**: The editor should support mobile touch gestures for scrolling, zooming, and selecting text.

- **Behavior**:
  - **Fluid Layout**: Ensure that as the screen size changes, the layout adapts fluidly without causing content to overlap or become hidden.
  - **Media Responsiveness**: Images, tables, and embedded media should scale appropriately based on screen size. For instance, large images should shrink to fit the screen width while maintaining aspect ratio.
  - **Responsiveness of Drag-and-Drop and Resizing**: Ensure that features like drag-and-drop and object resizing are touch-friendly and work smoothly across devices.
  
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:
  - The editor should be tested and optimized for major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) across both desktop and mobile platforms to ensure consistent performance.
  
- **Performance Optimization for Mobile**:
  - **Lazy Loading**: For large documents, load media elements (e.g., images, videos) only as they come into view to reduce initial load times and improve performance on mobile devices.
  - **Reduced Features for Mobile**: Certain advanced features (e.g., full-screen mode, complex drag-and-drop) may be limited or adapted for mobile environments to ensure smooth performance.

---

### **User Flow for Editor Layout**

- **Full-Screen Mode**:
  - Users can toggle full-screen mode by clicking a button in the toolbar or pressing a keyboard shortcut. This will expand the editor to fill the entire screen, hiding unnecessary browser or OS elements. Users can exit full-screen mode by pressing the escape key or toggling the button again.
  
- **Toolbar Customization**:
  - In the customization dialog, users can show/hide individual tools, rearrange the toolbar with drag-and-drop, and create custom groups for commonly used tools. These customizations will persist across sessions, and users can reset the toolbar to its default configuration if desired.

- **Responsive Layout**:
  - As users switch between different devices, the editor will automatically adjust its layout to suit the screen size. On mobile, the toolbar will collapse to only essential tools, while the content area will maintain optimal readability. On desktops, the editor will display the full set of features for a rich editing experience.

---

### **Performance Considerations**

- **Full-Screen Performance**:
  - Ensure that full-screen mode does not cause performance issues, especially in large documents with many images or videos. Use efficient rendering techniques to optimize for performance in full-screen environments.

- **Responsiveness on Large Documents**:
  - On smaller screens, optimize how large documents are rendered. Use **lazy loading** for media and smooth transitions for drag-and-drop operations to prevent lags and delays.

- **Mobile Performance**:
  - Implement touch gestures carefully, ensuring that dragging and resizing do not cause delays or performance drops, especially in mobile browsers with limited processing power.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **Full-Screen Exit Issues**:
  - Handle cases where the browser prevents the user from exiting full-screen mode (e.g., due to browser restrictions). Provide an on-screen button or clear instructions on how to exit.
  
- **Incomplete Toolbar Customizations**:
  - If users accidentally hide essential tools or create a toolbar layout that’s difficult to use, offer clear options to reset the toolbar to default settings. If advanced users modify shortcuts or hide complex features, provide a warning if the current layout is missing critical functionality.

- **Mobile Device Limitations**:
  - Certain advanced features like complex drag-and-drop or resizable elements may be harder to use on mobile devices. Provide simplified interactions (e.g., tap-to-edit, touch-friendly resizing handles) to improve the mobile experience.

---

### **9. Customization & Theming - Detailed Specification**

---

#### **9.1 Theme Options**

- **Overview**:
  - The editor will support multiple **theme options**, allowing users to switch between **light** and **dark modes** for a comfortable editing experience across different environments.

- **Light Mode**:
  - **Behavior**: This will be the default theme with a light background and dark text. All UI elements (toolbar, menus, dialog boxes) will be styled with light colors to ensure readability in bright environments.
  - **UI Adjustments**: Ensure that the contrast between text and background is high enough for visibility, and that media (images, embedded content) remains clear in the light theme.

- **Dark Mode**:
  - **Behavior**: A dark theme will invert the color scheme with a dark background and light-colored text. This mode will reduce eye strain in low-light environments and make prolonged editing sessions more comfortable.
  - **UI Adjustments**: Modify toolbar buttons, icons, and other UI elements to fit the dark background while ensuring they remain visible and distinct.
  - **Media Handling**: Ensure that images, videos, and other media are displayed correctly in dark mode, with adjustments for borders or brightness if necessary.

- **Theme Switching**:
  - **UI Element**: A button or toggle switch in the settings menu to allow users to switch between light and dark themes. Alternatively, provide an automatic theme adjustment option that adapts to the user's system or browser settings (using **media queries** like `prefers-color-scheme`).
  - **Persistence**: The selected theme should be saved either in local storage or tied to the user's account so that it persists across sessions.

---

#### **9.2 Custom Themes**

- **Overview**:
  - Allow users to create and apply **custom themes**, defining their own color schemes for text, backgrounds, toolbars, and other UI components. This feature caters to users with specific aesthetic preferences or accessibility needs.

- **Customization Options**:
  - **Text Colors**: Users can define custom colors for text, headings, links, and other inline elements.
  - **Background Colors**: Customize background colors for the main content area, toolbar, and menus.
  - **Button and Icon Colors**: Allow customization of the colors for toolbar buttons, icons, and interactive elements to ensure full personalization.
  - **Highlighting and Borders**: Users can define custom styles for highlighting text (e.g., background colors for selected text) and borders for elements like images, tables, or code blocks.

- **UI for Custom Themes**:
  - **Theme Editor**: Provide a **Theme Editor** in the settings menu where users can pick colors for different elements via a color picker. Each theme should have a preview option to allow users to see their changes in real-time before saving.
  - **Save and Apply Themes**: Users can save their custom themes and apply them immediately to the editor. Saved themes should be stored locally or in their account for use in future sessions.
  - **Default Themes**: In addition to light and dark themes, offer a few pre-configured themes (e.g., high-contrast, sepia) as a starting point for users who want customization but don’t want to start from scratch.

- **Sharing and Importing Themes**:
  - Allow users to **export** their custom themes as files and **import** themes shared by others. This feature encourages collaboration and the sharing of specific styles for different needs (e.g., themes optimized for accessibility).
  
---

#### **9.3 Language Localization**

- **Overview**:
  - The editor will support **multiple languages** for the interface, allowing users to switch the language of menus, tooltips, and dialogs. Localization should ensure that all aspects of the editor are available in the chosen language, including error messages and notifications.

- **Supported Languages**:
  - Initially, the editor will support **German**, **English**, and **Spanish**. More languages can be added in future iterations based on user demand.

- **Language Selection**:
  - **UI Element**: A language selection dropdown in the settings menu where users can choose their preferred language for the interface.
  - **Automatic Language Detection**: Optionally, the editor can detect the user's system or browser language settings and adjust the language automatically upon first load.
  
- **Localization Coverage**:
  - **Full UI Translation**: Every visible UI element (toolbar items, menus, dialog boxes, tooltips) will be fully translated into the selected language.
  - **Error Messages**: Ensure that error messages, alerts, and other notifications are also localized for consistency.
  
- **Implementation**:
  - Use **i18n (internationalization)** libraries to manage translations dynamically. Each language will be stored as a separate translation file, and the UI will adapt in real-time based on the user's choice.
  
- **Persistence**:
  - The chosen language should be stored in local storage or tied to the user’s account, so the editor retains the language preference across sessions.

---

### **User Flow for Customization & Theming**

- **Theme Switching**:
  - Users can toggle between light and dark modes from the settings menu. If a custom theme is applied, users will see their custom colors reflected in the editor. Theme changes take effect immediately and persist across future sessions.

- **Creating Custom Themes**:
  - Users access the **Theme Editor** from the settings menu. They can adjust colors for text, backgrounds, toolbars, and interactive elements. Once satisfied, users save the theme and apply it to the editor. They can also export their theme for sharing or import a shared theme file.

- **Language Selection**:
  - Users can change the language of the editor via the settings menu. The interface will dynamically update to reflect the selected language, including all menus, tooltips, and notifications. Language preferences will persist across future sessions.

---

### **Performance Considerations**

- **Efficient Theme Switching**:
  - Ensure that switching between themes is instantaneous and doesn’t require a full page reload. The editor should dynamically apply the new theme styles to all elements without noticeable delays.
  
- **Custom Theme Optimization**:
  - Optimize how custom themes are applied to ensure that large documents with many styled elements do not experience slowdowns or rendering issues.

- **Language File Loading**:
  - Language files should be lightweight and loaded only when necessary to avoid bloating the editor’s initial load time. Implement lazy loading for languages that aren’t immediately needed, ensuring a snappy experience.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **Conflicting Custom Themes**:
  - If users create custom themes with poor contrast or readability (e.g., light text on a light background), provide a visual warning or a way to preview the theme before saving. Consider offering predefined accessibility checks (e.g., high contrast recommendations) to avoid usability issues.

- **Language Inconsistencies**:
  - Ensure that no untranslated elements remain when switching languages. If a new feature is added, make sure translations are updated across all supported languages to prevent mixed-language interfaces.

- **Cross-Device Theming**:
  - If users switch devices (e.g., from desktop to mobile), ensure that their custom themes and language preferences sync correctly. If not synced, allow users to easily re-import their custom themes from saved files.

---
### **10. Plugin Architecture - Detailed Specification**

  - **New Objects or Widgets**:
    - Plugins can introduce new types of objects that users can insert into the document, such as custom charts, diagrams, or interactive components (e.g., quizzes, feedback forms).
  
  - **Custom Formatting Options**:
    - Developers can create plugins that add advanced text formatting or document styling options, such as custom heading styles, footnotes, or special character sets.

- **Plugin Security**:
  - **Sandboxing**: Ensure that plugins run in a sandboxed environment to prevent security risks. Plugins should not have direct access to the file system or external networks unless specifically allowed.
  - **Validation**: The plugin manager should validate plugin files before installation, ensuring they don’t contain malicious code or unsupported functionalities.

---

#### **10.2 Plugin Hooks**

- **Overview**:
  - The editor will provide **event hooks** that plugins can use to interact with the editor's core functionality. This allows plugins to modify content, react to user actions, or provide additional features in real-time.

- **Supported Plugin Hooks**:
  - **onTextChange**:
    - Triggered whenever the user modifies the document's text (e.g., typing, deleting, or applying formatting).
    - **Use Case**: Plugins can monitor text changes for grammar or spelling errors, or update live character/word counts.
  
  - **onObjectInsertion**:
    - Triggered when the user inserts an object into the document (e.g., images, tables, videos).
    - **Use Case**: Plugins can add special behaviors when an object is inserted, such as auto-resizing, adding metadata, or triggering custom sidebars for advanced object properties.
  
  - **onObjectSelection**:
    - Triggered when the user selects an object in the document (e.g., clicks on an image or table).
    - **Use Case**: Plugins can provide additional actions when an object is selected, such as displaying custom context menus or offering further editing options.

  - **onDocumentSave**:
    - Triggered when the document is saved or auto-saved.
    - **Use Case**: Plugins can perform tasks like running validations, converting content, or integrating with external storage solutions (e.g., saving to a cloud service or triggering notifications).

    - Triggered when the user applies or removes text formatting (e.g., bold, italic, heading).
    - **Use Case**: Plugins can track formatting changes to ensure style consistency across the document or apply custom formatting behaviors (e.g., adding tooltips or inline comments).

- **Custom Hooks**:
  - Developers can define their own **custom hooks** based on specific plugin needs. For instance, a plugin could provide hooks for interactions with an external API (e.g., fetching content from a database or posting comments to a review platform).

---

#### **10.3 Plugin Lifecycle Management**

- **Initialization**:
  - When a plugin is activated, it will initialize itself by binding to the relevant hooks or injecting necessary UI elements (e.g., toolbar buttons).
  
  - **Dependencies**: If a plugin requires specific dependencies (e.g., external libraries), these will be loaded asynchronously during initialization to avoid blocking the editor’s performance.

- **Execution**:
  - Plugins will execute within a sandboxed environment and communicate with the editor through defined APIs and hooks.
  
- **Unloading**:
  - When a plugin is deactivated or uninstalled, it should properly clean up any UI elements, hooks, or settings it introduced, ensuring no residual code remains in the editor.

---

### **User Flow for Plugin Architecture**

- **Installing a Plugin**:
  - Users can open the **Plugin Manager** from the settings menu. They will have options to browse a marketplace (if available) or upload plugin files. Once selected, the plugin will be installed, and users can immediately activate it.

- **Configuring a Plugin**:
  - After installing a plugin, users can configure it via the **Plugin Manager**. They can adjust settings like toolbar button behavior, add API keys (if needed), or change plugin-specific preferences. Changes will take effect immediately.

- **Using a Plugin**:
  - Once activated, plugins will be accessible from the toolbar or via context menus. Users can use plugins to insert new objects, apply advanced formatting, or integrate third-party services into the document.

- **Managing Plugins**:
  - Users can activate, deactivate, or uninstall plugins from the **Plugin Manager** at any time. If a plugin is no longer needed, users can remove it without affecting the rest of the editor’s functionality.

---

### **Performance Considerations**

- **Sandboxed Execution**:
  - Ensure that plugins are isolated from the core editor to avoid performance degradation. Plugins should run in a separate execution context where their impact on the editor's speed and memory usage is minimized.
  
- **Efficient Hook Management**:
  - Ensure that event hooks (e.g., `onTextChange`, `onObjectInsertion`) are executed efficiently, especially in real-time editing scenarios. Plugins should avoid long-running processes during hooks to prevent UI freezes or delays.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **Plugin Conflicts**:
  - Handle cases where two or more plugins try to modify the same part of the document or toolbar. In case of conflicts, provide a resolution mechanism (e.g., giving users control over plugin priority).
  
- **Unsupported Plugins**:
  - If a plugin is not compatible with the current version of the editor, notify users before installation and prevent the plugin from being activated.
  
- **Plugin Errors**:
  - If a plugin throws an error during execution, the editor should handle the error gracefully without crashing. Display clear error messages and allow users to disable the problematic plugin.

### **11. Security - Detailed Specification**

---

#### **11.1 Content Sanitization**

- **Overview**:
  - The editor must ensure that all content entering and leaving the system is **sanitized** to prevent **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks** and the injection of **malicious content**. This applies to both user-generated HTML and third-party content embedded in the document (e.g., from copy-pasting or external integrations).

- **Sanitizing HTML Input**:
  - **Behavior**:
    - All HTML input (whether from user-pasted content, file imports, or plugin-generated HTML) must be **sanitized** to strip out potentially dangerous elements (e.g., `<script>`, `<iframe>`, inline event handlers like `onload`, and other executable code).
    - Retain only **whitelisted tags** and attributes that are safe for rendering, such as `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<p>`, and formatting elements.
    - Allow **safe attributes** such as `href`, `src`, `alt`, and `title`, while ensuring that attributes like `javascript:` in links are blocked.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use a sanitization library (e.g., **DOMPurify**, **sanitize-html**) to clean up input before it is rendered or stored in the document.
    - Ensure that any HTML content passed through the editor (whether via direct input or third-party plugins) is subject to the sanitization process.
  
- **Sanitizing HTML Output**:
  - **Behavior**:
    - Before exporting or saving the document as HTML, sanitize the content again to remove any residual or dynamically added unsafe elements.
    - Ensure that when exporting to other formats (e.g., PDF, RTF, Markdown), no executable scripts or malicious tags are included in the export process.
  
  - **Implementation**:
    - Apply the same sanitization logic to the document output, ensuring that unsafe elements, tags, and attributes are stripped from the final document.

- **Handling Embedded Media**:
  - **Behavior**:
    - For media elements like images and videos, sanitize the `src` attributes to prevent the injection of unsafe content (e.g., ensure links cannot include `javascript:` URLs).
    - **Iframes and Embeds**: Disallow or heavily restrict the use of `<iframe>` and `<embed>` tags unless explicitly trusted. For trusted sources (e.g., YouTube embeds), sanitize the input to ensure safe usage.

- **Rich Text Pasting**:
  - **Behavior**:
    - When users paste content from external sources (e.g., websites, word processors), ensure that external styles, scripts, or potentially harmful content are stripped out.
    - The editor should preserve **safe formatting** (e.g., text styles, headers) while rejecting dangerous elements.
  
  - **Example**: If a user pastes content with embedded `<script>` tags from a webpage, those scripts must be removed before rendering the content in the editor.

---

#### **11.2 Validation of Uploaded Files**

- **Overview**:
  - To ensure that user-uploaded files (e.g., images, videos, documents) do not introduce vulnerabilities, the editor will implement **file validation** to check for supported formats and prevent the uploading of potentially harmful files.

- **File Type Validation**:
  - **Supported File Types**:
    - Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG.
    - Videos: MP4, WebM.
    - Documents: PDF, TXT, Markdown.
  - **Behavior**:
    - When a user attempts to upload a file, the system should first verify that the file type is allowed by checking the file’s MIME type and extension.
    - Reject any unsupported file types (e.g., executables or scripts) and provide a clear error message to the user.

- **File Size Validation**:
  - **Behavior**:
    - Implement a **maximum file size** limit for uploaded files to prevent users from uploading excessively large files that could degrade performance or lead to security vulnerabilities (e.g., denial-of-service attacks via large uploads).
    - If the file exceeds the size limit, the system should reject the upload and notify the user with an appropriate message (e.g., "File size exceeds the maximum limit of X MB").

- **Virus Scanning**:
  - **Optional Feature**:
    - If feasible, integrate with a third-party service or API (e.g., **ClamAV**, **VirusTotal**) to scan uploaded files for viruses or malicious content before they are allowed into the editor.
    - This ensures that malicious files (e.g., infected PDFs, corrupted images) are blocked at the upload stage.

- **Sanitization of Uploaded Files**:
  - **Images**: Strip any unnecessary metadata from uploaded images (e.g., EXIF data) to reduce the risk of metadata-based attacks.
  - **PDFs**: Sanitize PDFs to remove any embedded scripts or links that could trigger malicious behavior when opened. Only allow PDFs with simple, clean content (e.g., text and images).
  - **Videos**: Ensure that uploaded videos cannot contain embedded links or executable code that could be harmful when viewed.

- **Preview Handling**:
  - **Behavior**:
    - When files (e.g., images, videos) are uploaded, provide a **safe preview** that allows users to view the content before embedding it in the document.
    - For files that cannot be previewed (e.g., unsupported formats), display a fallback message rather than attempting to render unsafe content.

#### **11.3 Security Best Practices**

- **CSRF Protection**:
  - Implement **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** protection for any form submissions or data-saving actions in the editor. This prevents unauthorized actions being triggered by malicious third-party sites.
  - Use CSRF tokens that are unique to each session and are validated with every request that modifies content.

- **HTTPS Enforcement**:
  - Ensure that the editor is served over **HTTPS** to protect against **man-in-the-middle attacks**. All user data, including document content, media uploads, and settings, should be encrypted in transit.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - If the editor supports multi-user collaboration or admin features, implement **role-based access control** to restrict sensitive actions (e.g., plugin installation, file uploads) to authorized users only.

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
  - Set up a **Content Security Policy** to prevent unauthorized scripts, iframes, or resources from being loaded into the editor. This adds an extra layer of defense against XSS attacks.
  - Define a whitelist of trusted sources for content (e.g., trusted media providers) and block all others.

- **X-Frame-Options**:
  - Set the `X-Frame-Options` header to prevent the editor from being embedded in external iframes, which helps mitigate **clickjacking attacks**.

### **User Flow for Security Features**

- **Pasting External Content**:
  - When a user pastes content from an external source (e.g., a webpage or another document), the editor sanitizes the input to remove unsafe elements. Users can still see the pasted content with its original formatting, but any unsafe scripts or styles are stripped out.
  
- **Uploading Files**:
  - When a user uploads an image, video, or document, the file is immediately validated for type, size, and security. If the file passes the checks, it is embedded into the document. If not, the user receives an error message explaining the issue (e.g., "Unsupported file type" or "File size too large").
  
- **Secure Document Handling**:
  - Before saving or exporting a document, the content is sanitized again to ensure no unsafe HTML elements or attributes are included. The user can export a clean, safe version of their document in the desired format (HTML, PDF, etc.).

---

### **Performance Considerations**

- **Sanitization Efficiency**:
  - Ensure that content sanitization is performed quickly and efficiently, especially for large documents with many media elements or complex formatting. Use optimized libraries to avoid slowing down the editor.
  
- **File Validation Performance**:
  - Ensure that file type and size validation are handled immediately upon upload to prevent performance lags or interruptions in the user’s workflow. For virus scanning or sanitization of large files, consider background processing to maintain responsiveness.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- **Bypass Attempts**:
  - Handle cases where users attempt to bypass sanitization (e.g., by embedding malicious content in allowed tags like `<img>` or `<a>`). Ensure that all attributes are properly sanitized to avoid indirect XSS attacks.

- **Corrupted Files**:
  - If a user attempts to upload a corrupted or incomplete file, provide clear feedback on why the file is rejected. For example, if the file type is manipulated or the file does not fully load, reject it and inform the user.

- **File Duplication**:
  - If a user attempts to upload the same file multiple times, handle the duplication gracefully by reusing the existing file reference instead of re-uploading, while ensuring the validation and sanitization process is not skipped.
