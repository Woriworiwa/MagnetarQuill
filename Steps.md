#### **1. Text Formatting - Basic Features**
1. **Implement Bold, Italic, Underline, and Strikethrough**:
   - Develop core functionality for applying and toggling these formatting options using `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, and `<strike>` tags.
   - Add respective toolbar buttons and keyboard shortcuts.

2. **Develop Font Family & Font Size Dropdowns**:
   - Implement dropdowns for selecting font family and size, applying changes dynamically to the selected text.
   - Include common fonts (Arial, Times New Roman, etc.) and allow users to add custom fonts via URLs.

3. **Integrate Text and Background Color Pickers**:
   - Create color pickers for text and background colors.

   - Enable list item creation on `Enter` and provide a toolbar toggle for list types.

5. **Enable Custom Headers (H1-H6)**:
   - Develop header options (H1 to H6) in the toolbar, allowing users to quickly change paragraph styles.
   - Provide keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+1` for H1, `Ctrl+2` for H2).

6. **Integrate Indentation Control for Lists & Paragraphs**:
   - Implement indentation increase and decrease for lists and paragraphs using `Tab` and `Shift+Tab`.

    - Ensure plugins can be activated, deactivated, and configured via a plugin manager.
